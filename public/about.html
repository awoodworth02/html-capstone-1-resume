<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Native born Texan.  We moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma when I was 12 years old. I graduated high school at Daniel Webster High.  
  Six months after graduation I joined the the Air Force after my twin brother convinced me I would get training and travel if I enlisted. 
  I retired after 21 years with a break in service.  I re-entered the military when I decided to pursue my college degree.  I originally worked 
  missile career field where I worked on the B52 aircraft missile system and the Short Range Attack Missile. I retrained into the Information Technology 
  career field after 10 years active duty. </p>

<p> During my time in the military I married and had 5 children.  It was challenging, but I continued pursing my goal to get my college degree. 
    I also eventually divorced and spent 10 years as a single parent.  That did not prevent the military from deploying me to the middle east. My
    mother came to take care of my children which should have been for 70 days but was changed to 180 days.  This was also during Y2K which everyone 
    was anxious to see if the computer world was going to shut down!
</p>

<p>Before retiring from the Air Force I completed my degree. I also met and married my current husband.  I Retired after Stop Loss after 9/11 tragedy.  
  I then accepted a contract to deploy with the Air Force through General Dynamics contract for Information Technology.  I made several trips to Iraq 
  and two to the United Arab Emirates. It was challenging to go to a country in the aftermath of war, but it was an experience.  Once my grandchildren 
  started to arrive and the mothers were young teen moms without a mother in the picture. I decided to request a change to a non-deploying position. 
  I then began working for the Federal Polygraph school at Fort Jackson, SC.  It was a good move and I was able to be involved with my grandchildren 
  as they came along. After 14 years at the polygraph school, I have now recently retired and am now working on keeping busy and creating web pages as a side hobby.
